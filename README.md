# nand2tetris
This is my personal repo of nand2tetris projects.

## Overview
[nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) is an online educational course centered around learning the hardware and software heirarchy of modern computers through hands-on projects wherein students build each layer of the abstraction using the tools and specifications provided by the course.

The [software suite](https://www.nand2tetris.org/software) is available on their web site. I've opted to not include those tools in this repo, and instead only include my personal implementations of each project.
